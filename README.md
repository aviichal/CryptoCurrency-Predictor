# CryptoCurrency Predictor

## Problem Statement

The CryptoCurrency Predictor dashboard provides insights into cryptocurrency market trends, helping traders and investors make informed decisions. It leverages historical data to forecast price movements, assess market volatility, and track portfolio performance. By analyzing key metrics, traders can refine their strategies, mitigate risks, and optimize their investments.

### Steps followed 
Step 1: Loaded historical cryptocurrency data into Power BI Desktop (dataset in CSV format).

Step 2: Opened Power Query Editor and enabled "Column Distribution," "Column Quality," and "Column Profile" options under the View tab.

Step 3: Selected "Column Profiling Based on Entire Dataset" to analyze data consistency and completeness.

Step 4: Identified missing values in price data and handled them appropriately using interpolation.

Step 5: Created calculated columns for key performance indicators (KPIs), including:

7-day moving average price

30-day moving average price

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Percentage change in price

Step 6: Applied data transformations to normalize trading volume and market capitalization.

Step 7: Designed an interactive dashboard with multiple visual elements:

Line Charts: To display historical price trends and moving averages.

Bar Charts: To compare daily percentage changes across different cryptocurrencies.

Heatmaps: To visualize market volatility and correlation between assets.

Slicers: To filter data by date range, asset type, and market condition.

Step 8: Created a DAX measure to compute predicted price based on past trends:

Predicted Price =
VAR Previous_Close = SELECTEDVALUE(Crypto_Data[Close])
VAR Moving_Avg = AVERAGEX(FILTER(Crypto_Data, Crypto_Data[Date] >= TODAY() - 7), Crypto_Data[Close])
RETURN Previous_Close * (1 + (Moving_Avg - Previous_Close) / Previous_Close)

Step 9: Built a portfolio tracker displaying total investments, profits/losses, and return on investment (ROI).

Step 10: Designed an alert system using conditional formatting to highlight overbought and oversold conditions based on RSI values.

Step 11: Created an insights panel summarizing market trends, top-performing assets, and trading recommendations.

Step 12: Published the report to Power BI Service for real-time monitoring and accessibility.
